📊 Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Python Visualization Project

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using Matplotlib, one of the most powerful and widely used plotting libraries in Python.
The notebook covers various types of plots used in data analysis to visually explore patterns, trends, distributions, and relationships within datasets.
The objective of this project is to build a strong foundation in creating clear, informative, and visually appealing charts for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

🎯 Objectives

Understand the basics of Matplotlib
Create different types of plots
Customize graphs (titles, labels, legends, colors)
Improve visual clarity and presentation
Apply visualization techniques to real datasets
